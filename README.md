# KBBQ

Welcome to the repository for the KBBQ bot, a bot created to help [KBBQ](https://discord.gg/call).

## Self Hosting

To run this bot you need to be on at least node.js `v18`, from there make sure you have
NPM installed and run `pnpm install` to install all of our dependencies.

Once all of our dependencies are installed please duplicate `.env.example` to .`.env.prod`
and `.env.dev`, then modify all the values accordingly.

To run the production version of this bot please run `pnpm start`, if any errors come
out feel free to contact Polar#6880 if he still works on the project! (Make sure to compile your TypeScript files first
with `tsc`)

If you want to run the development version run `pnpm build`.

The only difference between the production and development version is that the development
has debug logs to assist with development.

### Licensing

Having access to this repository allows you to freely use the code within it however you please,
but if the developer (Polar#6880) no longer works on this project he will not be held responsible
for any damages, issues, or problems that may arise.
