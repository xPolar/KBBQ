# KBBQ

Welcome to the repository for the KBBQ bot, a bot created to help [KBBQ](https://discord.gg/kbbq).

## Self Hosting

To run this bot you need to be on at least node.js `v16.6.2`, from there make sure you have
NPM installed and run `npm install` to install all of our dependencies.

Once all of our dependencies are installed please rename `.ENV_EXAMPLE` to `.env`, and
modify the values accordingly.

To run the production version of this bot please run `npm run prod`, if any errors come
out feel free to contact Polar#6880 if he still works on the project!

If you want to run the development version run `npm run dev`.

The only difference between the production and development version is that the development
version won't log statuses into our desired console webhook and only listens to users within
the admin configuration option.

### Licensing

Having access to this repository allows you to freely use the code within it however you please,
but if the developer (Polar#6880) no longer works on this project he will not be held responsible
for any damages, issues, or problems that may arise.
